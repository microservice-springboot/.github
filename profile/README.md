## Hi there 👋
## 1. Introduct
Service we are going to build: 

- Product Service: Create and view product, acts as Product Catalog
- Order Service: Can order product
- Inventory Service: Can check if product is in stock or not
- Notification Service: Can send notifications, after order placed
- Order Service, Inventory Service and Notification Service: are going interact with each other
- Synchrous and Asynchronous Communication


**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
